1.01  Tue Dec 28 21:50:20 CET 2004
	- compile sndlib with -fPIC or equivalent.
        - fixed some typoes, and many minor bugs
          (thx to oesi).
        - open soundcards in nonblocking mode when initializing,
          avoiding blocks on lesser hardware.
        - avoid in-place fftw as they are documented gto work but simply
          barf.
